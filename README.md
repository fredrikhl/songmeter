songmeter
=========

Stupid script for displaying song info and progress with [GeekTool][gt].


To use
------

1. Run `make` in the source catalog to compile the applescript. i
2. Run one of the script to produce some output
   
   * `osascript songstat.scptd`
   * `bash songmeter.sh`

   Note that iTunes or Spotify must be running _and_ playing a song for the
   script to produce any output

3. Enjoy, or not.

TODO
----

* Learn applescript, clean up the applescript
* Make more effective
* Rewrite the bash script in a more sane language, like python or perl

  **OR**

  in an *insane* language, like applescript
